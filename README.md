9-3 and 9-30 files are final clustering models used for clustering Titanium and Manganese edges of X-ray absorption spectra (XAFS, XANES). 
Clustering done by distance of spectra and slopes of spectra. 

8-10 files used to test clustering algorithms on data

9-1 test of data to ensure that data was properly classified and read by an ML model
